Guide:


Welcome to Summer Butterfly. A key part of the summer experience is sharing how your summer is going so you can inspire everyone to take maximum advantage of the season!! For this purpose our home page has two forms, one where you type in your name (or your fun summer pseudonym if you prefer anonymity), and another form where you share your fun summer vibes with the world (in the form of words). Once you have filled these out, hit the post button to get your thoughts out there and participate in the season. If you are done posting and just want to look at what has been posted hit the show posts only button and if you change your mind and want to post again press the make new post button and you are back in business.


tldr to post fill the fields then click post. To change page click either show posts only or or make new post


User Story:


Our user Zoe D. hates how all the other blogging sites don't remind her of her favorite season. She wants a website that is fun and summer themed. She wants to see her posts and posts from her friends displayed in a fun summery fashion. Sometimes she wants to post but sometimes she wants to just take in the posts so her ideal website would have separate pages for posting and page viewing. Sometimes she slips up and sends a post that does not have summer vibes. She wants to be able to correct her mistake and take the post off the website. Sometimes her ex Joe G. L. makes annoying posts so if she can delete those too that's even better.
